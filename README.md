This Python script uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a news summarization tool. The tool leverages the `newspaper3k` library to fetch articles from user-provided URLs. It then uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information from the article, such as:

-   **Title**
-   **Author(s)**
-   **Publication Date**
-   **Summary**

Additionally, it performs sentiment analysis on the article text using the `TextBlob` library, determining whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

**How it works:**

1.  **GUI Setup:** The GUI consists of text boxes to display the extracted information, a text box for entering the URL, and a "Summarize" button.
2.  **Summarize Function:** When the button is clicked:
    -   It retrieves the URL from the input box.
    -   It downloads and parses the article using `newspaper3k`.
    -   It applies NLP to extract the title, author, publication date, and summary.
    -   It performs sentiment analysis and displays the result.
3.  **Display:** The extracted information and sentiment analysis results are shown in the respective text boxes.

**GitHub README Summary:**

This project provides a simple GUI-based tool for summarizing news articles and performing sentiment analysis. It utilizes libraries like `newspaper3k`, `nltk`, and `TextBlob` to automate the process. You can easily input a news article URL, and the tool will quickly present you with a concise summary and sentiment analysis.

**Key Points:**

-   **Easy to use:** Simple interface for entering URLs and viewing results.
-   **Quick summarization:** Quickly get the gist of news articles.
-   **Sentiment analysis:** Understand the overall tone of the article.
-   **Built with:** Tkinter, newspaper3k, nltk, TextBlob

**Potential improvements:**
